# R-slice Implementation Notes (builder deviation log)

Branch `r-slice/opus`, worktree cut from `origin/feat/1.0.0` @ ffd62216.
Binding spec: `CONTEXA-IMPL.md` §8 (11-item acceptance) + Appendix A rows
DR-01/02/03/04/05/06/07/09/10/12/27/31/32 (with P37 corrigenda). Claim schema:
`PRODUCT-DESIGN.md` §3.

## Baseline (pre-change, pristine worktree)

`packages/core` suite: **5 failed | 451 passed | 2 todo (458)**. The 5 failures are
PRE-EXISTING living-repo doc-churn fragility (they ingest THIS repo and assert on
`CONTEXA-IMPL.md` content/ranking, which drifted since the tests were pinned — the
documented `living-repo-tests-fragile-to-doc-churn` hazard). They are NOT my
regressions; "green" below means "no new failures beyond these 5":
- `1e-docs.test.ts > A5-adr`
- `1f-selection.test.ts > A6-search`
- `1g-serve.test.ts > A7-drill`, `> A7-why`
- `2d-callgraph.test.ts > B4-mention (parseDiffHunks in CONTEXA-IMPL.md)`

## Key cross-cutting design decision (Decisions)

**D-SHADOW — `authority` retained as a compatibility shadow while `derivation` +
`confidence` become canonical.** DR-02 says "split EVERY persisted `authority`
field". The literal reading is to *remove* `authority`; its blast radius is 106
references across 20 core files + CLI + ~22 test files. A single-session full
removal is high-risk for leaving the tree red, which the goal prompt forbids
("STOP … with everything green rather than leaving a half-phase"). Conservative
interpretation taken (scope contract): I ADD `derivation`+`confidence` as the
persisted, canonical trust fields (columns + TS DTOs + committed grammar tokens),
computed centrally by one helper (`store/trust.ts::trustFor`) and backfilled per
DR-02; `authority` stays populated as a denormalized shadow so existing
readers/tests keep working, but it is no longer the *source* of trust. Full
removal of the `authority` column is recommended follow-up (see Open questions).
Nothing reads `authority` for a *new* trust decision; ranking is unchanged
(still reads the shadow) to avoid perturbing golden/living-repo rankings — logged,
not in the DR-02 acceptance item.

## Per-phase / per-DR log

(sections filled as each DR lands)

### Phase 1 — Schema + backfill — COMPLETE (green)

Commits: `44119a71` (DR-02/05/09 schema), `a3ea1102` (DR-03), + Phase-1-complete
commit (DR-06/DR-10 + living-repo cochange robustness).

- **DR-02 (spec: split every persisted `authority` into derivation+confidence,
  backfill from carrier+method+actor, never enum/authorship, ambiguous→unknown,
  CONFIRMED needs corroboration).** Done via `store/trust.ts` (`trustFor`,
  `memoryTrustFor`) — the single matrix; migration `006` backfills existing
  claims/memory/memory_events with a CASE that mirrors it; new writes compute it
  centrally in `addClaim`/`writeMemory`/`appendMemoryEvent`/`ingestMemoryEvent`.
  Committed grammar (`serialize.ts`) carries new `deriv`/`conf` tokens with
  back-compat parse (legacy lines → recomputed at ingest). `authority` kept as
  shadow (D-SHADOW). CONFIRMED is never assigned at backfill/write (property
  tested). Ambiguous (carrier migration/system, unknown method) → null/null.
- **DR-03 (spec: computed per-claim `status` view).** `serve/status.ts::
  memoryClaimStatus` — never a stored column; projection exactly per Appendix A
  (active→resolved, needs-review(drift)→stale, needs-review(pending)→unknown,
  unresolvedHere→unavailable, superseded→stale, open contradiction→conflicting,
  restricted disclosure→restricted, retired→unavailable). Added
  `store.openContradictions()` mirroring `openStaleSuspects`.
- **DR-05 schema half (spec: `disclosure` column default local).** Added to
  `memory` (migration 006), default `'local'`, surfaced on `MemoryRow`. Full
  enforcement is Phase 3.
- **DR-06 (spec: bind published generation to the D32 tuple; reject/rebuild on
  mismatch; two worktrees sharing a shard don't cross-serve).**
  `store/generation.ts` (tuple = repo rev, worktree digest, schema version,
  analysis-policy version; digest). `generations.identity`/`building_identity`
  columns; stamped at begin/publish; `publishedGen` is identity-guarded (returns
  0 on mismatch → source reads unpublished → refresh rebuilds under the current
  tuple; index-not-copy loses nothing). Test seam `openStore({worktreeId})`
  simulates a second worktree on the same shard. DEVIATION: repo-rev is IN the
  tuple, but the guard is evaluated once per store session (identity cached at
  first generation touch), so within-session incremental ingest is unaffected;
  only a genuinely different worktree/schema/policy (or a legacy NULL-identity
  generation) triggers rebuild. This matches "reject/rebuild on mismatch" without
  forcing a full re-parse mid-session.
- **DR-09 (spec: cut served_count/last_served).** Dropped in migration 006;
  removed from `MemoryRow`/`getMemory`; the obsolete `S2-A7` test rewritten to
  assert the columns are gone.
- **DR-10 (spec: equivalent as-of recompute path; wiring valid_from/valid_to not
  required; bare cut escalates).** `fold.ts::foldStatusAsOf` +
  `serve/status.ts::memoryStatusAsOf` — the event-sourced log already supports
  "answer as of T" by folding events with `at <= T` (the transaction-time axis of
  §3 bitemporality). `valid_from`/`valid_to` columns are KEPT (not cut — no
  escalation needed); the recompute path is provided and documented.

Living-repo robustness: `1d-git.test.ts > A4-cochange` pinned the exact top
co-change pair; this slice's own commits (store.ts+types.ts co-change) legitimately
overtook it — the documented living-repo fragility. Per the goal prompt's
robust-assertion rule the assertion now checks structural guarantees (support ≥ 9,
both endpoints resolvable `file:` entities, confidence band) not the exact pair.

### Phase 2 — Freshness wiring (DR-04) — COMPLETE (green)

- **Stale links excluded/downgraded in traversal AND ranking.** `linkConfidence`
  (select/subgraph.ts) now multiplies a `stale` edge by `STALE_LINK_PENALTY`
  (0.25) — this same value feeds frontier priority (traversal) and induced-edge
  confidence (→ `confidenceFactor`, ranking). Downgrade not hard-exclude, so
  connectivity is preserved but a drifted edge never outranks a clean one.
- **Header renamed honestly.** `freshnessLabel` (serve/render.ts): `fresh`→`indexed`
  (names the INDEX state, not content truth), `reconciling (...)`→`index-catchup
  (...)`. The false content-freshness word `fresh` is gone. Goldens regenerated
  (4 files: biography/context/facet/search — header line only).
- **Claim freshness = unknown-until-reverified.** With `fresh` removed the header
  never asserts content freshness; a drift-flagged memory's DR-03 status is `stale`
  (not resolved); acceptance test asserts the header never renders `fresh`.
- **Per-source decay class + re-verification scaffold** (serve/freshness.ts):
  `SOURCE_FRESHNESS` (file sources = content-hash/no-TTL; github/jira/confluence =
  snapshot-ttl) + `needsReverification`. Scaffold only — no connector wired (M4
  gated); it declares the freshness contract at the source boundary.

Tests: 4 DR-04 cases in r-slice.test.ts (24 total). Core = 5 baseline failures;
CLI 23 green.

### Phase 3 — Restricted enforcement (DR-05 serve half, item 7) — COMPLETE (green)

- **Secret guard on EVERY write path.** `remember.ts` now runs
  `scanMemoryForSecret` unconditionally (was mainline-only). A secret-shaped note
  on ANY surface (cli/mcp/local) is classified `disclosure = restricted`. Mainline
  still diverts to overlay + needs-review + remediation as before.
- **Restricted bodies out of FTS/render/MCP.** A restricted note's body is NEVER
  FTS-indexed (indexed as a redacted `⊘ withheld (restricted)` marker with empty
  text) → never searchable via FTS/MCP `search`. `select/project.ts` withholds a
  restricted memory body at render, emitting a cited withheld outcome
  `⊘ withheld (restricted) [handle]` (the `[handle]` is the citation) — the body
  (gist + detail) never reaches the consumer.
- **Rebuild-durable.** `reindex.ts` re-derives the disclosure via the same
  deterministic scan and applies the same FTS gate, so a restricted overlay note
  stays withheld across a from-scratch reindex / fresh clone (no grammar change
  needed — the scan is the source of truth).

Tests: 4 DR-05 cases in r-slice.test.ts (28 total): MCP secret note → restricted;
never searchable (gist words + secret all miss FTS); renders a cited withheld
outcome, body never leaks; non-secret note unaffected. Core = 5 baseline failures;
CLI 23 green.

### Phase 4 — Claim envelope at the boundary — PARTIAL (items 6, 10 green; item 8 not done)

DONE (green):
- **DR-07 minimum claim envelope DTO + builder + terse render.** `serve/envelope.ts`:
  `ClaimEnvelope` (subject, evidence{uri,revision?,hash?}, observedAt, derivation,
  confidence, status, freshness, disclosure); `claimEnvelopeFor(store, entity)`
  builds it for any entity (memory → row trust + DR-03 status + disclosure; other
  kinds → strongest backing claim + stale-edge status); `renderEnvelopeTerse`
  emits a 1-line glyph string (`‹D·L·resolved·content-hash·local› store:mem:…`),
  `?` on an unknown axis (never a likely fact). Drifted/stale → freshness
  `unknown-until-reverified`.
- **DR-31 serialize through MCP under caller scope.** `packages/cli/src/mcp.ts`
  attaches `structuredContent.envelopes` (built from the response diag's entity
  ids, never re-selected) to every `context`/`search` tool result — the same
  per-claim §3 axes an agent gets as a human (R6).
- **DR-01 accelerator-not-validated disclosure.** `ACCELERATOR_DISCLOSURE` on every
  MCP `structuredContent.disclosure`; the `context` tool description re-qualified
  from bare "Start any task here" to name it an accelerator index, not a validated
  oracle.

Tests: 6 DR-07/DR-01 core cases (r-slice.test.ts, 34 total) + 1 DR-31 MCP case
(cli mcp.test.ts, 24 total).

NOT DONE (see "Where I stopped"):
- **DR-32 push-block de-claiming (item 8, use-blocking).** Requires OMITTING the
  factual gotcha lines entirely + rewording the "with provenance" header. The
  push-block/1h-push tests are deeply coupled to gotcha rendering (~25 asserts);
  the rewrite is bounded but sizeable and was not reached in this session. The
  push block still renders `⚠ gist [handle]` gotchas + the "with provenance"
  header on this branch — NOT yet compliant with DR-32.
- Full serve-path rendering of the terse envelope inline in the human `text` was
  NOT wired (would churn the golden transcripts); the envelope reaches the machine
  consumer via MCP `structuredContent` (DR-31) and is available to any human-render
  via `renderEnvelopeTerse`, but the default `context()` markdown text is unchanged.

### Phase 5 — Tail — NOT DONE

## Deviations

- D-SHADOW (above): `authority` kept as a shadow column rather than removed.
- DR-06 identity is cached once per store session (see Phase 1 note) so
  within-session incremental ingest is preserved; a mismatch (other worktree /
  schema / policy / legacy NULL) rejects and rebuilds. Faithful to "reject/rebuild
  on mismatch" without forcing a mid-session full re-parse.
- DR-10: `valid_from`/`valid_to` columns retained (not cut) alongside the as-of
  recompute path, so no LAW-side escalation was needed.
- `1d-git.test.ts > A4-cochange`: brittle exact-pair ranking assertion relaxed to
  structural guarantees (living-repo robust-assertion rule) after this slice's own
  commits shifted the top co-change pair.

## Adjacent-found (untouched)

## Open questions

- Full removal of the legacy `authority` column/field (DR-02 literal) — deferred;
  recommended as a dedicated mechanical follow-up once derivation+confidence are
  proven in review.
